# AutoSort
**Multimodal deep learning for real-time stable tracking of month-long neural activities from the same cells**

AutoSort is designed to tackle two significant challenges in long-term stable recording. 
- First, it efficiently aligns neurons over the course of long-term recordings to ensure consistent tracking of the same neurons each day. 
- Second, it accurately sorts spikes while maintaining the precision throughout the recordings, ensuring that the performance achieved at the first of the recordings is sustained throughout the later days.

AutoSort innovatively leverages multimodal features as inputs. We extract single-channel waveform, multi-channel waveform, and the inferred spatial location for any potential spike that exceeds a certain threshold on any particular channel to be sorted.
